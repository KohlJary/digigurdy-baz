These are "Scenes"--their term for presets--for the bs-16i iOS app that is often used for the DigiGurdy.  As far as I can tell, you can manually share them like this... it works between my i-devices.

In your iCloud storage, or somewhere in your Files is a `bs-16i` folder, and in it is a `Scenes` folder.  Put these there and they should show up.

* G-C Tuned -- this does a little scale tuning to make the melody strings 8 cents apart and the drone/trompette a few cents apart.  It also has the LFO (vibrato) setting that I use with a MELODY_VIBRATO of 16 (see the CONFIG SECTION of the main code).

This Scene expects the vienna-alto-mod11.sf2 soundfont (also found in this repo) to be set up in bs-16i, as well as the default one.
